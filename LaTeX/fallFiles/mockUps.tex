\chapter{Mock ups}

\section{Introduction}
	The conceptual model illustrates through mock ups how the system will appear to different actors who might use the system. The webpage will look the same overall, however it has small differences between users who decide to create an account and users who don’t have an account.  Figure 5.1 shows the overall view. This remains the same for both users. Figure 5.2 shows the settings that can be manipulated under “My Settings”. Figure 5.3 shows the page for how one would make an account.
