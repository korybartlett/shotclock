\chapter{Requirements}

\section{Introduction}
	Requirements define and qualify what the system needs to do. Functional requirements specifically define what must be done and what the solution must do. Non-functional requirements have to do more with performance and reliability and thus, talk about how the functional requirements need to be achieved. Lastly, design constraints constrain the solution rather than the problem.
\section{Functional Requirement}
	\begin{itemize}
    \item Critical
    	\begin{itemize}
        \item The system will allow the user to see a steady stream of videos
        \item The system will allow the user to search for videos
        \item The system will allow the user to add videos to his video queue 
        \item The system will contain correct game statistics
    	\end{itemize}
   	\item Recommended
    	\begin{itemize}
		\item The system will give the user the ability to sign in and sign out 
        \item The system will allow the user to customize his or her settings in order to create a more personalized experience
    	\end{itemize} 
    \end{itemize}
\section{Non-Functional Requirement}
	\begin{itemize}
    \item Critical 
    	\begin{itemize}
    	\item The system will be put together using user friendly UI 
        \item The system will be  easy to  navigate 
        \item The system video portal will be consistently laid out between pages
        \item The system will be extensible to work for varying sports leagues        
    	\end{itemize}
    \item Recommended
    	\begin{itemize}
        \item The system will be secure and have a well tested sign in process 
    	\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\section{Design Constraints}
	\begin{itemize}
    \item Critical
    	\begin{itemize}
    	\item The system must be web-based 
    	\end{itemize}
	\item Suggested
    	\begin{itemize}
        \item CSS frameworks and other modern libraries should be used because of its ability to create good looking UI 
        \item Sport themed images and icons are encouraged in order to go with the theme of the project 
    	\end{itemize}
